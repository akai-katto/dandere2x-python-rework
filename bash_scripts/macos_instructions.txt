** ON NEW INSTALLATION **

On a new installation, you will need to use "brew" package manager to install ffmpeg.

You can install brew from here: https://brew.sh/

You will need to install "ffmpeg" via brew. The command to do that, via a Terminal Instance, is "brew install ffmpeg".

*** WHENEVER YOU DOWNLOAD A NEW RELEASE OF DANDERE2X, YOU MUST FIRST ***

1) "Option + right-click" the 'dandere2x' file and click "Open". A window will be prompted,
   asking if you run the unverified application. Press "Open". Give it 10 seconds, and it should crash. You may receive
   a notification that it had crashed, this is to be expected. 

2) Navigate to the 'externals/waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan-server/' folder. "Option + right-click" the 'waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan'
   file and follow the same "Open" instructions as Step 1). The program will close instgantly. 

What these steps do is they allow your Mac operating system to allow dandere2x + waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan to run,
from a permission perspective.

You only need to do this once per release.

** TO RUN ONCE YOU COMPLETED THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS **

1) Find the dandere2x release folder you extracted, likely named "dandere2x_macos", and right-click the folder,
   and select "New Terminal in Folder". This is the folder containing the files "dandere2x_start.sh" and "dandere2x",
   as well as other folders named "gui" and "externals".

2) In the terminal that was just opened, type "bash dandere2x_start.sh". Give it a few seconds, as it takes pyinstaller
   a brief moment to load the executable.
