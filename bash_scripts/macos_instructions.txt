*** WHENEVER YOU DOWNLOAD A NEW RELEASE OF DANDERE2X, YOU MUST FIRST ***


1) "Command + right-click" the 'dandere2x' file and click "Open". Give it a few seconds, and it should crash.
2) Navigate to the 'externals/waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan/' folder. "Command + right-click" the 'waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan'
   file and "Open". The program will crash.

What these steps is it allows your mac operating system to allow dandere2x + waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan to run,
from a permission's perspective.

You only need to do this once per release.

** TO RUN ONCE YOU COMPLETED THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS **

Right click on the folder housing the dandere2x-release, and "New Terminal in Folder". 
In the terminal that was just opened, type "bash dandere2x_start.sh". Give it a few seconds, as it takes pyinstaller
a brief moment to load the executable.
