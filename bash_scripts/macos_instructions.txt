** ON NEW INSTALLATION **

On a new installation, you will need to use "brew" package manager to install ffmpeg.

You can install brew from here: https://brew.sh/

You will need to install "ffmpeg" via brew. The command to do that, via a Terminal Instance, is "brew install ffmpeg".

*** WHENEVER YOU DOWNLOAD A NEW RELEASE OF DANDERE2X, YOU MUST FIRST ***

1) "Command + right-click" the 'dandere2x' file and click "Open". A window will be prompted,
    asking if you run the unverified application. Press "Open". Give it 10 seconds, and it should crash.
2) Navigate to the 'externals/waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan/' folder. "Command + right-click" the 'waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan'
   file and follow the same "Open" instructions as Step 1). The program will crash instantly.

What these steps do is they allow your Mac operating system to allow dandere2x + waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan to run,
from a permission perspective.

You only need to do this once per release.

** TO RUN ONCE YOU COMPLETED THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS **

Right-click on the folder housing the dandere2x-release, and "New Terminal in Folder".
In the terminal that was just opened, type "bash dandere2x_start.sh". Give it a few seconds, as it takes pyinstaller
a brief moment to load the executable.
