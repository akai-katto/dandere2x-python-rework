# Some Linux / Windows knowledge is needed to understand how this file is setup.

# In `load_executable_paths_yaml` in `yaml_utils.py`, I check the operating system of the user.
# If the user is windows, then replace / with \\ and add a .exe to the end. This is mostly due to
# windows pathing being frustrating to work with (\ being an escape character) and not wanting to have to
# maintain two different yaml files for each operating system.
# Furthermore, .exe will be added if the system is windows.
#
# This allows one executable file to work on both operating systems, removing the need for having to maintain
# two separate configurations.

# ~Sorry, I promise there isn't more hidden complexities for yaml files beyond this.
